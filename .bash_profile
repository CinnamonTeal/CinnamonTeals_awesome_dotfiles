# Paths

    # The USR_PATHS variable will just store all relevant /usr paths for easier usage
    # Each path is seperate via a : and we always use absolute paths.

    # A bit about the /usr directory
    # The /usr directory is a convention from linux that creates a common place to put
    # files and executables that the entire system needs access too. It tries to be user
    # independent, so whichever user is logged in should have permissions to the /usr directory.
    # We call that /usr/local. Within /usr/local, there is a bin directory for actually
    # storing the binaries (programs) that our system would want.
    # Also, Homebrew adopts this convetion so things installed via Homebrew
    # get symlinked into /usr/local
    export USR_PATHS="/usr/local:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/bin"

    # Hint: You can interpolate a variable into a string by using the $VARIABLE notation as below.

    # We build our final PATH by combining the variables defined above
    # along with any previous values in the PATH variable.

    # Our PATH variable is special and very important. Whenever we type a command into our shell,
    # it will try to find that command within a directory that is defined in our PATH.
    # Read http://blog.seldomatt.com/blog/2012/10/08/bash-and-the-one-true-path/ for more on that.
    export PATH="$USR_PATHS:$PATH"

    # If you go into your shell and type: $PATH you will see the output of your current path.
    # For example, mine is:
    # /Users/avi/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p392/bin:/Users/avi/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p392@global/bin:/Users/avi/.rvm/rubies/ruby-1.9.3-p392/bin:/Users/avi/.rvm/bin:/usr/local:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/mysql/bin:/usr/local/share/python:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:
